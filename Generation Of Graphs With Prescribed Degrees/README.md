# IE456-Graph-Algorithms-and-Applications

This GitHub repository features a comprehensive project conducted for the IE456-Graph Theory & Applications course at Boğaziçi University in the Spring of 2023. The project is focused on the comparison of algorithms for generating random graphs with prescribed degree sequences, delving into the intricacies of the sequential algorithm by Blitzstein and Diaconis among others. It explores the algorithm's efficiency, its implementation, and its advantages over traditional methods like Erdős-Rényi and Havel-Hakimi algorithms. Through detailed experimentation, the project assesses the performance of these algorithms in terms of runtime, connectivity, and the necessity of edge swaps to achieve graph connectivity. The findings underscore the sequential algorithm's unique approach to generating graphs that closely mimic the degree distribution observed in real-world networks, making it a valuable tool for the study of complex systems. This endeavor not only illuminates the strengths and limitations of various graph generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of graph theory by offering insights into the structure and dynamics of synthetic and natural networks.
