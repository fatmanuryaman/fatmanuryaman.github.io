# Time Series Forecasting & Model Comparison
This GitHub repository showcases a project from the IE360 Time Series & Forecasting course at Boğaziçi University, conducted in the Fall of 2023. Focused on advanced time series analysis techniques, the project, completed by Fatmanur Yaman, delves into moving average models, forecasting, error analysis through Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and sample covariance calculations. Utilizing R programming, the study methodically explores linear and polynomial regression, emphasizing the model's efficacy in predicting future values and assessing performance with precision metrics like MSE and MAPE. Additionally, the project investigates autocorrelation to understand the data's time-dependent structure, providing a holistic view of time series forecasting's challenges and solutions. The detailed analysis, which includes forecasting new observations and evaluating model performance through error metrics, contributes significantly to the understanding of time series models' applicability and accuracy in predicting real-world phenomena.
