<h5> This study explores the effectiveness of different machine learning
algorithms for multi-class classification in the context of human activity
recognition. It introduces and applies classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVMs,
KNNs, XGBoost, and Neural Networks to a comprehensive dataset collected
from smartphones equipped with inertial sensors.</h5>


<h5>The findings indicate that XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy and F1
score compared to the other tested models. However, it is important to
consider specific task requirements, such as interpretability, computational
complexity, and the significance of precision or recall, when selecting the
most appropriate model. Both SVM and the Neural Network also exhibited
outstanding performance, providing viable alternatives for different
application scenarios.</h5>
