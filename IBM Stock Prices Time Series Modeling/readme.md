# IBM Stock Prices Time Series Modeling
This GitHub repository hosts a project for the IE360 Time Series & Forecasting course offered by Boğaziçi University in Spring 2023, focusing on analyzing and forecasting IBM's weekly stock prices. Utilizing an ARIMA(0,2,1) model, the project addresses the challenges of non-stationary time series data through differencing techniques, and employs autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analyses to identify underlying patterns. The endeavor culminates in the successful forecasting of stock prices, showcasing the application of time series modeling techniques. This comprehensive analysis not only highlights the practical use of ARIMA models in financial forecasting but also serves as an academic exercise demonstrating the application of theoretical concepts in real-world financial data analysis.
