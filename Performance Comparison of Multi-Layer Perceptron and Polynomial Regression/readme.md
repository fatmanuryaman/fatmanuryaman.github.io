# Comparison of Multi-Layer Perceptron and Polynomial Regression
This GitHub repository features a project for the IE440 - Nonlinear Models in Operations Research course at Boğaziçi University, focusing on the comparison and application of linear, polynomial regression, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models for complex nonlinear problems. Conducted in the Fall of 2023 by Team Optimizers, the project employs regression techniques to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) function and explores the efficacy of MLP models with varying input units through detailed experimentation. Utilizing sigmoid activation, forward and backpropagation, the study meticulously optimizes the models over thousands of epochs, achieving notable predictive performance. The results particularly highlight the superiority of the MLP model with two input units, demonstrating its lower test MSE and variance, thereby showcasing the potential of MLP models in capturing complex nonlinear relationships more effectively than traditional regression methods. This comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable academic contribution, providing insights into the application of advanced modeling techniques in operations research.
